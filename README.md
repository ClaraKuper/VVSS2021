#### Code for the Poster Contribution A 133 "Go- no-go decisions based on gradually revealed visual information" at V-VSS 2021
##### by Clara Kuper
##### April 2021

In this code, I will review and discuss the data from a pilot experiment. Substantial parts of this analysis are 
presented at V-VSS 2021 in poster session A, on Saturday, the 22nd of May 2021. Also includes analysis beyond the figures presented on the poster, to facilitate understanding.

In this notebook, do the following:

0. Load the needed libraries and data files

1. review the data 
    
    a. describe size, structure
    
    b. show basic behavioural measurements (V-VSS 2021 Figures & Code)
    
    
2. describe different strategies to solve the task
    
    a. explain how hit probability was computed
    
    b. compare ideal observers using different strategies
    
    c. fit linear models to models the response type (go/ no-go). (V-VSS 2021 Figures & Code)
    
    d. fit linear models to the reaction time (V-VSS 2021 Figures & Code)
    
    
3. describe the time windows that had an influence on the response (V-VSS 2021 Figures & Code)
    
    a. modeled forwards, from the start of each trial
    
    b. modeled backwards, from the response in each trial
    
    
5. describe 3 mechanisms, based on drift diffusion models, and compare their simulated output to 3. (V-VSS 2021 Figures & Code)
